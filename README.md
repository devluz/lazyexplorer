ShittyExplorer is a Don't Starve Together Mod that allows you to discover the whole map (including caves) by 
automatically moving your character across the whole map. Open the map and then use console command 'shittyexplorer()'.
Ideally use c_godmode() before to avoid diing while exploring the map.
